title: 2018-2019 Coordinated readings
subtitle: To help educate evolutionary biologists about the kinds of questions that marine scientists care about and to help educate marine scientists about the kinds of questions that evolutionary biologists care about, we have developed a recommended reading list of classic papers in both fields.
---

Our coordinated reading groups will meet every two weeks to discuss two papers covering each of a series of topics in marine and evolutionary biology.  Groups participating in these discussions can meet at their home institutions once during each two-week period (any time during the two weeks is fine), either as part of a lab meeting or another seminar or journal club.  Participants will discuss the papers listed for that week, and address the discussion questions provided with each topic.  For each topic, the group should then choose one person to summarize the group’s reaction to the papers and discussion questions on a Slack channel we have set up to facilitate discussions at [evolvingseas.slack.com](evolvingseas.slack.com). Discussion groups can also use the thread feature in Slack to post additional questions, and react to comments or questions posed by other groups.

## Theme and rationale
For our first set of coordinated readings, we decided to examine the scale of spatial and temporal variability in the ocean, with a focus on how this variability may influence evolutionary processes. We are interested to have discussions about how adaptive change in populations may be structured in space and time, particularly below the scale of gene flow. Some of the readings were also designed to spark discussions about what constitutes evidence for adaptation and how we should design studies to study adaptation. Keep in mind there are many themes that we hope to discuss in the future (e.g., plasticity, evolutionary rescue, eco-evo dynamics and evolution in a community context, epigenetics) if this first set of coordinated readings is successful.

We encourage all participants who would like to attend one of our workshops in the next three years (Synthesis, Genomics, or Training/Integration) to pariticipate in the discussions on the Slack channel.

## Week 1 (Deadline for discussion January 19)

### Topic - Spatial and temporal scale of environmental variation

**Rationale:**

The ocean is structured in space and time, both in the benthic and pelagic realms. While benthic structure is similar to strcuture in terrestrial systems, there are only weak terrestrial parallels to pelagic structure which is critical to both habitat pattern and dispersal in the ocean. This week we want the RCN to think about how the scales of environmental variabiilty are reflected in evolution of marine populations.

Richard R. Strathmann

**Discussion Questions:**

1. Are marine systems less or more variable environments than terrestrial systems and how does this vary across scales? 

2. How can we link the scale of environmental variability to microgeographic adaptation in the ocean? Could other mechanisms be at play?

## Week 2 (February 2):

### Topic - Local adaptation (Conceptual)

**Rationale:**

This week we want the RCN to think about different ways we define local adaptation and come to a concensus as a network on a definition of local adaptation that we should use.

**Paper 1:**  (Paper and Link)

[Conceptual issues in local adaptation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00684.x)

[A practical guide to measuring local adaptation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.12150)

François Blanquart, Oliver Kaltz, Scott L. Nuismer & Sylvain Gandon


**Discussion Questions:**

1. What are the implications of how we individually define local adaptation for how we study it and what we think about the processes that drive it?

2. What definition of local adaption should we (the RCN-ECS network) use?


## Week 3 (February 16):

### Topic: Local adaptation - Case Studies 

**Rationale:**

Many consider reciprocal transplant experiments to be the gold standard for demonstrating local adaptation, but recently genomic data collected from different populations has been used to argue for local adaptation. This week we want the RCN to compare and constrast different approaches toward measuring local adaptation.

**Paper 1:**  (Paper and Link)

Bryan Kolaczkowski, Andrew D. Kern, Alisha K. Holloway & David J. Begun

**Optional Background Paper:**

**Discussion Questions:**

**Perhaps switch questions 1 and 2?***

1. When does landscape genomic data present good evidence of local adaptation (without experiments)?

2. How do the different research approaches (experiment vs. genomic) give different insights? 

3. How are the processes that drive local adaptation in the snail differ from the fly? How are they similar?

## Week 4 (March 2):

### Topic: Evolution of genomic architecture

**Rationale:**

Many marine species are characterized by high gene flow. Traditional population genetic theory predicts that local adaptation will only evolve when the strength of selection is greater than migration (gene flow). This week we want the RCN to consider different ways that local adaptation may evolve when the strength of selection is less than migration (gene flow) and the kinds of genomic architectures that evolve in this case.

**Discussion Questions:**

1. What kind of genomic architectures do we expect to evolve under high gene flow?

2. How does genomic architecture constrain adaptation?

3. What are the implications of different architectures for our ability to study adaptation from genomic data?

## Week 5 (March 16):

### Topic: Dispersal

**Rationale:**

Many marine species have a bipartite life cycle with a pelagic phase as larvae dispersed by currents, and a benthic stage as adults. This week, we want the RCN to think about how dispersal is a key driver of marine population dynamics, and the consequences of dispersal and life history for evolutionary dynamics.

**Discussion Questions:**

1. How might pelagic life histories with asymmetrical dispersal, coupled with genetic correlations between larvae and adult traits, constrain or promote adapatation?

2. When and where do we expect population genetic structure to be generated and/or maintained?

## Week 6 (March 30):

### Topic: Population genetics

**Rationale:**

Consequences of dispersal via ocean currents are potentially high variance in reproductive success and a combination of continuous and discrete genetic structure. This week we want the RCN to think about how dispersal via ocean currents may affect how we model evolutionary processes (like the coalescent), and potentially come to consensus on how we should describe genetic structure.

**Paper 1:**  (Paper and Link)

**Optional Background Paper:**

[Gene genealogies and the coalescent process](http://web.eve.ucdavis.edu/pbg298/pdfs/Hudson_OxfordSurveysEvolBiol_1991.pdf)

Richard R. Hudson

**Discussion Questions:**

1. What are the implications of sweepstakes reproduction for how we model evolutionary processes in the ocean?

2. Given the complexity of marine dispersal dynamics, do you think that we as a field should adopt the Bradburd et al approach for characterizing population structure?

3. Given the potential for high variance in reproductive success, overlapping generations, and a combination of continuous and discrete population structure, how should we sample for population studies? (across space and across cohorts)

## Week 7 (April 13):

### Topic: Genetic Load

**Rationale:**

Genetic load occurs when the fitness of a genotype in its environment is less than the theoretically optimum genotype. This week we want the RCN to consider different ways that oceanographic processes may create genetic load and how this relates to the scales of environmental heterogeneity.

Aneil F. Agrawal & Michael C. Whitlock

**Discussion Questions:**

1. What's the relationship between phenotype-environment mismatches and genetic load?

2. How does dispersal scale and the scale of environmental heterogeneity contribute to genetic load?

## Week 8 (April 27):

### Topic: Balancing selection

**Rationale:**

Balancing selection occurs when polymorphism is maintained in a metapopulation by selection. This week we want the RCN to consider empirical and theoretical arguments for how environmental fluctuations in time can maintain polymorphism in populations.

**Paper 1:**  (Paper and Link)

[Genomic Evidence of Rapid and Stable Adaptive Oscillations over Seasonal Time Scales in Drosophila](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004775)

Meike J. Wittmann, Alan O. Bergland, Marcus W. Feldman, Paul S. Schmidt & Dmitri A. Petrov



**Discussion Questions:**

1. What consitutes good evidence for fluctuating selection, especially if it's maintained by many loci with small effects?

2. What are the benefits (or consequences) of fluctuating selection for long-term changes in the environment?

## Week 9 (May 11):

### Topic: Plasticity

**Rationale:** Plasticity is the environmentally induced production of alternate phenotypes from a given genotype (Dewitt and Scheiner 2004). While the evolution of plasticity and the effects of plasticity on the evolutionary trajectory of populations are huge topics, this week we want to contrast a classic and more recent study in which plasticity evolved.

**Paper 1:**  (Paper and Link)

C. K. Ghalambor, J. K. McKay, S. P. Carroll, & D. N. Reznick

**Discussion Questions:**

1. Compare and contrast the two experiments. In what way are they similar and different?

2. How does plasticity in an ancestral population determine evolutionary trajectory? 

3. Do empirical results agree or disagree with theoretrical arguments?
